# 👋 Introduction

Hello! My name is **Lethabo Kgoele**, and I am a 20-year-old tech enthusiast originally from Pretoria. I studied at **CodeSpace**, where I had the opportunity to pursue my passion for coding and explore the world of software development.

Beyond technology, I have a deep appreciation for **music**, especially Hip-Hop and Rap, and I am an unapologetic **anime fan**—with _Naruto_ forever holding the top spot on my favourite anime list.

## 🎯 Interests & Core Values

I’m enthusiastic about building things that matter—whether it's a **web application, mobile app, or video game**. My goal is to create technology that **serves, inspires, and uplifts others**.

One of my biggest dreams is to **open a school** dedicated to teaching young people how to code. I genuinely believe that early access to programming can change the course of someone’s life, unlocking opportunity and confidence through skill-building.

## 📌 Short-Term Goals *(1–2 Years)*

- Sharpen my coding skills to confidently take on **independent projects**.
- Build a **portfolio of applications** that highlight my progress and creativity.
- Step into a **professional work environment** to learn how teams collaborate, tackle challenges, and ship real-world projects.

---

## 🚀 Mid-Term Goals *(3–6 Years)*

- Contribute to **real client projects**, whether through freelance work or employment in a company.
- Gain **firsthand experience** building impactful tools—be it web applications, a useful mobile solution, or even a fun indie game.
- Use this phase to lay the groundwork for my bigger vision.

---

## 🌱 Long-Term Goals *(7–10 Years and Beyond)*

- **Establish a tech-focused school** where young minds—especially from underrepresented communities—can learn to code, innovate, and dream bigger.
- Make a lasting impact through **education and technology**.
- And yes... I would love to **retire by forty**—not to stop working, but to live with full freedom, giving back and pursuing passion projects on my own terms.
