# 👋 Introduction

Hello! My name is **Lethabo Kgoele**, a tech enthusiast from Pretoria, South Africa. I studied at **CodeSpace Academy** in Cape Town, where I pursued my passion for coding and explored the world of software development.

Outside of tech, I have a huge love for **music**, especially Hip-Hop and Rap. I’m also an unapologetic **anime fan** — with _Naruto_ forever holding the top spot on my all-time favourites list.

## 🎯 Interests & Core Values

I’m passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences — whether it's a **web app, mobile app, or video games**. Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into backend development, with Python and C# as my primary languages. My mission is to build technology that **serves, entertains, and brings joy to people and clients alike**.

One of my biggest ambitions is to **open a school** dedicated to teaching young people how to code. I truly believe early access to programming can transform lives — by unlocking opportunities, building confidence, and nurturing problem-solving skills from a young age.

## 🌱 Long-Term Goals *(7–10 Years and Beyond)*

- **Establish a tech-focused school** where young minds—especially from underrepresented communities—can learn to code, innovate, and dream bigger.
- Make a lasting impact through **education and technology**.
- And yes... I would love to **retire by forty**—not to stop working, but to live with full freedom, giving back and pursuing passion projects on my own terms.
