### Introduction:

My name is Lethabo Kgoele, and I am currently 20 years old. I am a student at CodeSpace, based in Cape Town, where I am pursuing my passion for coding. In addition to my interest in technology, I have a deep love for music, particularly Hip-Hop and Rap, and I am also a fan of anime, with _Naruto_ being my all-time favorite.

**Interests and Values**:

- I aspire to create web applications and video games that serve and inspire others. I believe this work will not only help me grow as an individual but also provide valuable insights for my future projects. One of my greatest ambitions is to establish a school where young people can learn how to code. I firmly believe that starting early in the world of programming can lead to immense success and opportunities.

**Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

- Within the next year, I aim to strengthen my coding skills to the point where I can work independently on various projects. I hope to have built numerous applications that will serve as milestones in my journey. In two years, I see myself gaining experience in a professional environment, which will teach me the dynamics of teamwork and help me overcome challenges as I pursue both personal and professional growth.

**Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

- In three years, I envision myself working on web applications or games for clients, or possibly contributing my skills to a larger organization like the military. By the fourth year, I plan to actively work towards realizing my dream of starting a school. In five years, I will be fully committed to turning that dream into reality and making a meaningful impact through education and technology.

### My projects:

**I have utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in these projects, which reflect my current skill set and development progress.**

As a basketball enthusiast, I created a scorecard application that can be used during games at my younger brotherâ€™s school to keep track of scores. This project allowed me to combine my passion for the sport with practical coding solutions. - [Basketball Scorecard](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Basketball-Scorecard.git)

For this project, I sought to expand my knowledge of JavaScript beyond what I had learned in class. I incorporated functions such as a refresh button, the ability to choose numbers and symbols, and a "click to copy" feature after generating a password. - [Password Generator](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Password-Generator.git)

In this project, I integrated Firebase as a database to ensure data persistence even after page refreshes. This was a great learning experience, and I enhanced the appâ€™s accessibility and visual appeal by adding CSS features to make it more user-friendly. - [Add to Cart App](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Module_6_LETKGO330_PTO2401_GroupB2_Lethabo-Kgoele_SDF07.git)
