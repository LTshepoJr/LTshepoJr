### My projects:
### I used all 3 languages in these projects, HTML, CSS, JavaScript to complete these projects which highlight my current work so far.

I love basketball, so I wanted to create a scorecard because when basketball is being played at my little brothers school, they can use it to keep scores - [Basketball Scorecard](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Basketball-Scorecard.git)

A project that I wanted to go and learn beyond the scope of what I have learnt about JavaScript. Included functions like refresh button, numbers and symbols choice and click to copy after generating password - [Password Generator](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Password-Generator.git)

Using firebase as a database for the data to not be lost after refreshing was very interesting to learn, and added CSS features to stand out more and accesible - [Add to Cart App](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Module_6_LETKGO330_PTO2401_GroupB2_Lethabo-Kgoele_SDF07.git)
