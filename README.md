### Introduction:

My name is Lethabo Kgoele, and I am currently 20 years old. I am a student at CodeSpace, based in Cape Town, where I am pursuing my passion for coding. In addition to my interest in technology, I have a deep love for music, particularly Hip-Hop and Rap, and I am also a fan of anime, with _Naruto_ being my all-time favorite.

**Interests and Values**:

- I aspire to create web applications and video games that serve and inspire others. I believe this work will not only help me grow as an individual but also provide valuable insights for my future projects. One of my greatest ambitions is to establish a school where young people can learn how to code. I firmly believe that starting early in the world of programming can lead to immense success and opportunities.

**Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

- Within the next year, I aim to strengthen my coding skills to the point where I can work independently on various projects. I hope to have built numerous applications that will serve as milestones in my journey. In two years, I see myself gaining experience in a professional environment, which will teach me the dynamics of teamwork and help me overcome challenges as I pursue both personal and professional growth.

**Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

- In three years, I envision myself working on web applications or games for clients, or possibly contributing my skills to a larger organization like the military. By the fourth year, I plan to actively work towards realizing my dream of starting a school. In five years, I will be fully committed to turning that dream into reality and making a meaningful impact through education and technology.

### My projects:

**I have utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in these projects, which reflect my current skill set and development progress.**

As a basketball enthusiast, I created a scorecard application that can be used during games at my younger brother’s school to keep track of scores. This project allowed me to combine my passion for the sport with practical coding solutions. - [Basketball Scorecard](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Basketball-Scorecard.git)

For this project, I sought to expand my knowledge of JavaScript beyond what I had learned in class. I incorporated functions such as a refresh button, the ability to choose numbers and symbols, and a "click to copy" feature after generating a password. - [Password Generator](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Password-Generator.git)

In this project, I integrated Firebase as a database to ensure data persistence even after page refreshes. This was a great learning experience, and I enhanced the app’s accessibility and visual appeal by adding CSS features to make it more user-friendly. - [Add to Cart App](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Module_6_LETKGO330_PTO2401_GroupB2_Lethabo-Kgoele_SDF07.git)
