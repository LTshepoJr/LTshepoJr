# 👋 Introduction

Hello! My name is **Lethabo Kgoele**, and I am a 20-year-old tech enthusiast originally from Pretoria. I studied at **CodeSpace**, where I had the opportunity to pursue my passion for coding and explore the world of software development.

Beyond technology, I have a deep appreciation for **music**, especially Hip-Hop and Rap, and I am an unapologetic **anime fan**—with _Naruto_ forever holding the top spot on my favourite anime list.

## 🚀 Mid-Term Goals *(3–6 Years)*

- Contribute to **real client projects**, whether through freelance work or employment in a company.
- Gain **firsthand experience** building impactful tools—be it web applications, a useful mobile solution, or even a fun indie game.
- Use this phase to lay the groundwork for my bigger vision.

---

## 🌱 Long-Term Goals *(7–10 Years and Beyond)*

- **Establish a tech-focused school** where young minds—especially from underrepresented communities—can learn to code, innovate, and dream bigger.
- Make a lasting impact through **education and technology**.
- And yes... I would love to **retire by forty**—not to stop working, but to live with full freedom, giving back and pursuing passion projects on my own terms.

### 🎙️ [The Voice Pod](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/LETKGO330_PTO2401_GroupB2_Lethabo-Kgoele_DJS11)

The Voice Pod is an advanced, fully responsive web application using React, with TypeScript for the dynamic and reusable components, and CSS for the project's styling. The reliability of code will be ensured by using TypeScript, which uses type-checking, while the style will be encapsulated using CSS modules. Therefore, the overall result is an application scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly that can be taken as boilerplate and use by any web developer who decides to implement this or a similar project. This project includes:
- **Modular Design**: Components are designed for reusability and scalability.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type safety and autocompletion help prevent runtime errors.
- **Customizable Styling**: CSS modules and custom themes for flexibility.
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless user experience.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling and user notifications.
