### Introduction:

My name is Lethabo Kgoele. I am currently 20 years old. I am currently a student at CodeSpace which is based in Cape Town. I love coding and music especially Hip-Hop/Rap. I love anime, my all-time favorite is Naruto.

**Interests and Values**:

- I want to create web applications for people and games too, I want to be of service, it will help me develop as a person and give me ideas on how to create my applications or games and maybe create my own school. Creating a school is one of my biggest interest because learning how to code while you young is very prosperous.

**Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

- In a year I will have mastered coding, hopefully have built numerous projects and will help me in my journey ahead, in 2 years I see myself getting experience in a workplace and will help me understand how working in a team feels like, to get through all the challenges to ecstatic moments.

**Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

- In 3 years, I would be creating websites and applications for people, or working for the military, who knows, in 4 years I want to plan out my dream to create a school and in five yearsâ€™ work hard to pursue my dream.

### My projects:

**I used all 3 languages in these projects, HTML, CSS, JavaScript to complete these projects which highlight my current work so far.**

I love basketball, so I wanted to create a scorecard because when basketball is being played at my little brotherâ€™s school, they can use it to keep scores - [Basketball Scorecard](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Basketball-Scorecard.git)

A project that I wanted to go and learn beyond the scope of what I have learnt about JavaScript. Included functions like refresh button, numbers and symbols choice and click to copy after generating password - [Password Generator](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Password-Generator.git)

Using firebase as a database for the data to not be lost after refreshing was very interesting to learn, and added CSS features to stand out more and accessible - [Add to Cart App](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Module_6_LETKGO330_PTO2401_GroupB2_Lethabo-Kgoele_SDF07.git)
