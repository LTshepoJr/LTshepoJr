### Introduction:
My name is Lethabo Kgoele. I am currently 19 years old, turning 20 end September. I am currently a student at CodeSpace which is based in Cape Town.I love coding and music especially Rap. I love anime too, my all time favourite is Naruto.

**Interests and Values**:
- I want to create web applications for people and games too, I want to be of service, it will help me develop as a person and give me ideas on how to create my applications or games and maybe create my own school, why only learn coding when you done with school when you can also learn it while you growing up

**Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
- In a year I will have mastered coding, hopfully have build numerous projects and will help me in my journy ahead, in 2 years I see myself getting experience in a workplace and will help me understand how working in a team feels like, to get through all the challenges to ecstatic moments.

**Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
- In 3 years I would be creating websites and applications for people, or working for the military, who knows, in 4 years I want to plan out my dream to create a school and in 5 work hard to persue my dream.

### My projects:

I love basketball, so I wanted to create a scorecard because when basketball is being played at my little brothers school, they can use it to keep scores - [Basketball Scorecard](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Basketball-Scorecard.git)

A project that I wanted to go and learn beyond the scope of what I have learnt about JavaScript. Included functions like refresh button, numbers and symbols choice and click to copy after generating password - [Password Generator](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Password-Generator.git)

Using firebase as a database for the data to not be lost after refreshing was very interesting to learn, and added CSS features to stand out more and accesible - [Add to Cart App](https://github.com/LTshepoJr/Module_6_LETKGO330_PTO2401_GroupB2_Lethabo-Kgoele_SDF07.git)
